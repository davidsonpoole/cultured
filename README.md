# Cultured

The idea of this project was to create a website that would be an up-to-date country list with information on the culture. This information could be used primarily for investment purposes, but also to learn about the country for travel, current affairs, and/or personal interest.

Some key sections of each page would be:
- Imports
- Exports
- Trading Partners
- Top Songs
- Largest Cities
- Top Companies
- Travel

As I got busy and life got in the way, work on this project eventually halted. The greatest achievement that came from this was me figuring out how web scrapers work and implementing one. I did this in scraper.js, to scrape the top 10 songs in the US from Billboard.com. I then took these songs and organized them into a list in Country.jsx.

**Run the App**
1. Clone the project into your directory of choice `git clone https://github.com/davidsonpoole/cultured.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies `npm i`
3. Run the development version of the app `npm run dev`
4. Observe that the top 10 songs are the current top 10 songs in America
